Email_Sender
This uses python to send an email
Please note that if you decide to use this code it is made for sending an email through Gmail not anything else 
Also take note to change the email sender 
once you do this you must turn on your 2-step verification and create an app that will give you a 16 character password that will go 
in the variable name Email_Password not your actual email password
